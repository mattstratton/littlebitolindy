# All about Lindy

I am Lindy. I like shiny things. When friends of mine see restaurants that have &#8220;Lindy&#8221; as their name, they take a picture and send it to me. Lately, people keep saying I look like Katy Perry and I find that hilarious. I have a lot of random thoughts racing through my head, so I figured this would be a perfect place to share.

## What is &#8220;A Little Bit O&#8217; Lindy&#8221;?

This blog is where I blog about anything I see fit. I plan on doing a lot of experiments. This whole blogging thing makes me uncomfortable, and I know that when you&#8217;re uncomfortable that&#8217;s when you learn the most about yourself. So hopefully this entire thing isn&#8217;t a big disaster.

## How can you reach me?

## Tech stuff

This site runs a custom WordPress theme designed by <a href="http://www.mattstratton.com" target="_blank">Matt Stratton</a>. It is based on the <a href="http://www.rootstheme.com/" target="_blank">Roots</a> theme, which is itself based on <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. Code is written using a combination of <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" target="_blank">Coda2</a> and <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/" target="_blank">CodeKit</a>. Matt will write some more stuff eventually and may even make the git repo public.

The site uses HTML5 heavily and is (theoretically) a responsive design. There&#8217;s also neat use of LESS, which Matt has had to learn but thinks is very cool
