&nbsp;

So I recently noticed that my social media outlets are all completely different.  Don&#8217;t judge me; just keep reading.

&nbsp;

I probably spend the most time on Facebook.  I have too many friends on there, but since it&#8217;s so out of hand, I&#8217;m not going to spend an entire day going through each person to see what value they bring to my life.  I&#8217;d rather just unfriend the annoying ones when they bother me.

&nbsp;

My friends on Facebook are from all walks of life.  I have a lot of childhood friends, and a lot of them make me happy that we&#8217;re still friends as adults.  A handful of them make me question if we had the same fundamental education, and most of them have completely different political views than I do, but I know they&#8217;re good people.

&nbsp;

I also have a ton of friends on Facebook that I met through my career.  They are all incredible people that I truly love and admire, and some of them are even like family to me.  Speaking of family, I have some of them on Facebook, too.  It&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds.

&nbsp;

And then I have a TON of dance friends on Facebook.  Admittedly, there are probably a couple hundred that I have no clue who they are, but since we had 368 mutual friends, I accepted the request.  Probably the crazy part is that I really do know about 1,800 of them, and each of them has touched my life in a profound way.  I&#8217;ve learned so many things from these friends, and I can really say that a lot of these people have shaped the person I am today.

&nbsp;

So that about sums up my Facebook, but then I had some friends that told me I should get on Twitter.  Honestly, I have the strangest hodge podge of people I follow on there that I rarely go to really look at all the tweets. It blows me away how people can post SO MUCH and think that people really care that you just went pee in a gross bathroom.

&nbsp;

Some of the people I follow on Twitter are my Facebook friends, which just seems redundant to me, but whatever.  Then I spent a day following a lot of comedians, and when the Oscars were on last night, I was happy I made that decision.  Seriously, there are some creative and hilarious people out there.

&nbsp;

I also spent a week or so following A LOT of paleo people.  If you don&#8217;t know what paleo is, you&#8217;re missing out.  It&#8217;s the type of lifestyle I want to live, but really can&#8217;t do it 100% because I&#8217;m not home to prepare my own meals.  It&#8217;s ridiculously tough for me, but occasionally when I read Twitter, I am motivated to try to eat better because of all the inspiring individuals I follow.

&nbsp;<figure id="attachment_1072" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 640px">

<img class="size-full wp-image-1072" alt="Paleo!  No grains, dairy, legumes, alcohol, or sugar.  Also known as, the no fun diet.

&nbsp;

And then there&#8217;s Instagram.  I got on it sometime last year and LOVE seeing all the pics from friends.  The crazy part is that it&#8217;s mostly like Twitter when you can follow just about anyone.  Within a first few days, I had someone follow me from the Maldives, which is now a place I totally want to go to because I followed him back and his pictures are breathtaking.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m currently following 1,282 people, and I&#8217;d say at least half of them are amazing tattoo artists.  Makes no sense to me since I only have two tattoos and I got them both when I was 18 years old.  They look like complete crap and I promised my dad that I wouldn&#8217;t get anymore tattoos after he accidentally saw the second one.  I&#8217;ve kept that promise, but I secretly LOVE tattoos.  Well, let me revise that by saying that I love GOOD tattoos.  And just like makeup, tattoos have come a long way since I was 18.

&nbsp;

I think that one day I&#8217;ll cover both of my arms in full sleeves of tattoos.  My dad will disown me, my mom will cry, and my grandparents will roll over in their graves.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1069" alt="Can you believe this is a tattoo??  45 hours to complete!

&nbsp;

And then there are a few other miscellaneous social networking sites that I&#8217;m rarely on.  Pinterest just makes me want to shop or eat, so I try to stay away&#8230;.unless I&#8217;m searching for something useful or I&#8217;m really, really bored.

&nbsp;<figure id="attachment_1070" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 640px">

&nbsp;

I kind of do Foursquare, but don&#8217;t ask me to explain it.  I just check in places for absolutely no reason and occasionally will leave a &#8220;tip.&#8221;  I have yet to learn the purpose of it, or more importantly why I do it in the first place.

Path is an app that I thought would be my saving grace.  All I really want is one app that will rule them all.  The idea was to post something on Path, and then it would magically post the same thing on Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Well, Path sucks.  There&#8217;s totally a glitch on that dang app and I&#8217;ve deleted it and re-loaded it too many times to count.  It only worked once, and basically when I say that, it just means that all of my Facebook posts showed up on my Path for one day.  ONE DAY!  Worthless.

&nbsp;

I&#8217;m also on LinkedIn, but that doesn&#8217;t really count, right?  It&#8217;s just for career stuff.

&nbsp;<figure id="attachment_1073" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 640px">

<img class="size-full wp-image-1073" alt="Uh huh.  Sure." src="/wp-content/uploads/2013-02-12-09.18.58.png" width="640" height="960" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2013-02-12-09.18.58.png 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2013-02-12-09.18.58-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Uh huh. Sure.</figcaption></figure> 

&nbsp;

And then there&#8217;s Google +.  I seriously forget I have this.  I remember signing up when it came out.  We all thought it would replace Facebook, but it didn&#8217;t.  And although it may be superior in a lot of ways, I just simply forget to post anything there.  Again, if I just had one app that would post everywhere, I&#8217;d be a happy camper.

&nbsp;

The biggest problem with all of this is that the future means interacting in person less, and reading about other people&#8217;s lives more, but that&#8217;s for a completely different post which will be titled &#8220;The Fear of our Future&#8230;..or something like that.&#8221;
