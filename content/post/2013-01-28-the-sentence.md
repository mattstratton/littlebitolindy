Again, my apologies for not writing over the past two weeks.  I&#8217;ve been swamped with work, dancing, and an uninvited cold.  But now I&#8217;m back to let you know I can really shake &#8217;em down.  (Two points to anyone who started singing.)

&nbsp;

Okay, so I&#8217;ve been thinking about which story I should share.  Several of my closest friends have heard this story, but it&#8217;s definitely a story that&#8217;s worthy of sharing with the masses.

&nbsp;

Back in 2010-2011, I worked at a medspa.  It was the first time that I had veered from cosmetics for many years, and it was an incredible learning experience.  I worked with an amazing group of women that made a stressful job so much freaking fun.  We did a lot of different services there, but probably the most popular was laser hair removal.  On my second day, one of the aestheticians lasered my underarms so I could know what it felt like. And It felt like someone was raking a hot needle across my skin, so needless to say, it wasn&#8217;t very pleasant.  What I did love was the results, though.  Apparently I&#8217;m a prime candidate because I&#8217;m pasty white and my hair is dark.  Goody!

&nbsp;

I had only worked there a couple of months when the aesthetic manager came into my office with a huge, cheesy smile.  I&#8217;m not saying that Holly wasn&#8217;t a lovely person, because she absolutely was, but she rarely came into my office with a smile that big.  I stayed seated with a look on my face that I&#8217;m sure was like, &#8220;Yes?  I&#8217;m frightened.&#8221;  Then Holly did a little dance and said with a happy, sing-song voice, &#8220;Are you ready to get your hoo-ha done?&#8221;  I stayed sitting&#8230;frozen to death.  Now I did love the results of my underarms, but I wasn&#8217;t interested in any of my co-workers seeing my cookie.  They should at least buy me dinner and a drink first, but apparently Holly needed to train a new girl, Kim, on our lasers.

&nbsp;

And if I wasn&#8217;t scared enough, Holly informed me that they needed Kim to watch Holly perform a full Brazilian.  So for those of you that don&#8217;t know, with laser hair removal, you actually shave the day of your treatment.  I was pretty sure I could easily get out of this by just telling Holly that I hadn&#8217;t shaved that day.  She was obviously prepared for such an objection, as she came running back to my office with a cheap razor and a can of Barbasol.

&nbsp;

I had an hour to shave and then put on the numbing cream.  The only bathroom was a public one in the building, so that wasn&#8217;t going to work.  I decided to use a room in the office that had a sink, but didn&#8217;t require a lot of use from my co-workers.  My hilarious co-worker, Paige thought it would be funny to keep popping by the door and saying she was going to walk in, since she knew the door didn&#8217;t have a lock.  I can&#8217;t even begin to say how many times I yelled at Paige while I was in that room shaving my unmentionables.  That was incredibly defeating, but nowhere near the actual experience itself.

&nbsp;

After the numbing cream had kicked in some, I was instructed to go to the room and change into a robe.  Holly was really kind to have two stress squeeze balls ready for me on the bed.  I felt a bit humiliated with my legs spread open, but I tried to just focus on the pain.  After about 15 minutes, I thought the whole process was over.  You can&#8217;t imagine my relief!  But then Holly instructed me to &#8220;flip over.&#8221;  Flip over?  FLIP OVER!?!  I immediately felt my sweat glands kick into overtime.  I mean, I&#8217;ve had a Brazilian before, so I knew this was a possibility.  I shaved there just in case, but I was really praying it wouldn&#8217;t come to that.

&nbsp;

I flipped over and then Holly said, &#8220;Oh, you missed a spot shaving.  No big deal.  I&#8217;ll get that for you.&#8221;  As if this whole process hadn&#8217;t been humiliating enough, my co-worker was about to shave my crack.

&nbsp;

And then Holly uttered a sentence that you should NEVER hear from a co-worker&#8230;..

&#8220;Lindy, I nicked your butthole.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8230;&#8230;

&nbsp;

I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing, which made me clench.  And then Holly laughed.  And then the new girl, Kim, laughed.  And then I laughed some more.

&nbsp;

Needless to say, my hoo-ha and my butt crack recovered just fine.  It&#8217;s just my pride and self-esteem I continue to worry about.

&nbsp;

P.S. I was told that I had to attach pictures to my posts, but since I refuse to put a picture that might go with this story, here&#8217;s a picture of a kitten.
