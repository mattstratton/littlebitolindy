Why do parents give you a name and then never call you by it?  I seriously don&#8217;t understand it.  My first name isn&#8217;t Lindy, but I&#8217;ve only had two people that actually call me by my real name, which is Belinda.  Sometimes I even forget that my name is Belinda.  It&#8217;s always confusing at the doctor&#8217;s office even though I&#8217;ve been going to the same place for over 10 years now.

&nbsp;

I don&#8217;t know about anyone else, but when I was little I wanted to know how I got my name.  I was told that I was named after my dad&#8217;s high school sweetheart.  And now that I&#8217;ve shared that, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;What did Lindy&#8217;s mom think about that?&#8221;  Because that&#8217;s what everyone says after I tell them.  And then I tell them that my mom must have not cared.  Lydia has never really been a jealous person.

&nbsp;

So my dad named me Belinda, but they always called me Lindy.  Actually, the strangest part is that no one even calls me Lindy.  Almost all of my friends and family members have a different name for me.  And I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m going to share all of these because I&#8217;m incredibly embarrassed by a few, but here goes nothing.

My friend, Sarah Long, calls me Linda because she knows it pisses me off.

My brother calls me Innie-Lay.  I guess it was a weird pig-Latin thing.

My sister calls me Ni.  Pronounced knee.  Long story, but I had a hard time saying Lindy when I was little and I would call myself Ninny.  My sister just shortened it to Ni.

My friend, Tammy, calls me LinLin&#8230;.which I really don&#8217;t like, but I can&#8217;t tell her that.  She means well.

My friend, Kelly, calls me Belunda.  We used to work with a Lundy and people kept messing up my name, so that was her solution.

My friend, Nora, calls me LinDAY.  I actually like it when she says my name because it&#8217;s just so her.

My co-workers refer to me as Left Eye.  I have a problem with my left eye occasionally.  I might share more about that later.

My mom and dad both call me Stinky.  This is the worst one that I NEVER share with anyone.  According to my parents, I wasn&#8217;t a smelly child, but I did feel the need to be a stinker that got into everything.  Hence the name.  They used to call my sister Chigger, but somehow she grew out of her name.  I&#8217;m 34 and my parents still call me Stinky.  It&#8217;s awful.  Feel sorry for me.

And one of my favorite nicknames came from my grandparents.  They called me Little Bit.  And yes, this is also why I named the blog the way I did.  I wish my grandparents were still around.  They died 10 years and 10 days apart and were married for 65 years.<figure id="attachment_1010" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 225px">

So since everyone butchers my name, I had a necklace made about six months ago that says Lindy.  It was kind of a joke, but deep down I thought this would help since I&#8217;m constantly around new people with my job.  I had the necklace for less than a week and had to go to Houston for work.  I spent six hours working with this girl when she said, &#8220;Who&#8217;s Lindy?&#8221;  Everyone might think that in that moment I would have had a witty comeback, but all I could squeak out was, &#8220;that&#8217;s me.&#8221;  You know you&#8217;ve made a solid impact on someone when they have no idea what your name is.  She replied with, &#8220;Oh, I thought your name was Linda.&#8221;

Well played, Sarah Long.  Well played.
