Hi!  I&#8217;m Lindy.  I seriously have no idea what I&#8217;m doing.  And I just mean with this whole blog thing.  I know what I&#8217;m doing with my life.  I&#8217;ve been a makeup artist for a very long time.  I&#8217;ve been in the industry since I was 19, and now I&#8217;m 34.  You do the math because it&#8217;s just too weird for me.  I&#8217;m also an aesthetician and have been obsessed with skin for a long time as well.  I can&#8217;t forget to mention my infatuation with eyebrows. Yes, I stare at yours when we&#8217;re talking. I&#8217;ve had a love affair with dance my entire life, and besides makeup, it&#8217;s really the only thing I&#8217;m good at doing. I love animals (except pigeons).  I could watch a movie every day, but have the worst luck at theaters because the loudest idiot always sits right behind/next to me.  And I&#8217;m doing the best I can to eat a paleo diet, but I absolutely suck in the kitchen.  Oh, and I&#8217;m a spelling/grammar nazi, but I spelled something wrong the other day and I&#8217;m still not over it.  I&#8217;m single, happy, from Texas, and I&#8217;m a liberal.  Yeah, so that&#8217;s basically me.  A girl full of oxymorons.

&nbsp;

So I have two friends that have been pushing me to do a blog for a while now.  And when I say &#8220;pushing&#8221; I really just mean they&#8217;ve mentioned it a couple of times.  Both of them want me to do a fashion/makeup type blog.  I&#8217;ve been hesitant on doing a blog like that because I feel like the market is just overly saturated with that stuff.  And I just feel like there&#8217;s more to me.  So even if my blog isn&#8217;t &#8220;successful&#8221; because I decide to write about a multitude of things, then so be it.

&nbsp;

So what the heck am I going to write about?  Well, I just figured this would be the place for me to share.  There will be times I probably share too much, but that&#8217;s who I am.  I just want to live my life as authentically as I can.  I know that there are times this will make me vulnerable, but I guess that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve signed up for.

<img class="img-fluid" alt="Hi! I'm Lindy. I share too much and I like having purple in my hair.  I also take pictures of myself in my car." src="/wp-content/uploads/me1-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/me1-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/me1-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/me1.jpg 612w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Hi! I&#8217;m Lindy. I share too much and I like having purple in my hair. I also take pictures of myself in my car.</figcaption></figure> 

&nbsp;

So be prepared for the antics that will surely ensue.  I want to challenge myself to writing every day, but I doubt that will happen.  Regardless, I&#8217;m going to do my best.  This entire thing is a challenge anyways since I&#8217;m stoopid with computers.
