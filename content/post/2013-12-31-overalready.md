So I started this blog in 2013 with the hopes that I could have a place to share more than what I do on Facebook and other social medias. I also hoped that I would be able to become a better writer by writing on a more regular basis. Practice makes progress, right? Well, I suck. I wrote a handful of times and then didn&#8217;t make this a priority anymore. So while I feel badly about that, let me catch you up on my amazing life.

The first six months of 2013 weren&#8217;t what I was hoping for.  Of course I had plenty of good moments, but there was a dark cloud that seemed to loom over my head.  Then I had a co-worker who reached out to me and subsequently improved my life substantially.  All she did was care about my well-being.  I will never forget what she did for me, and I will forever hold her in very high regard.  Slowly, but surely, things started to improve in my life and the cloud got smaller.

I joked around that I must have fallen and bumped my head, but from March to May (I think) I decided to try online dating (again). To say it was a disaster would be an understatement.  It did make for some hilarious moments, though.  It also exhausted me and I was quickly reminded that I don&#8217;t believe online dating is the way for me.  Oh, and I also learned that ALL MEN LIE.  Hehe. Just kidding. Not really.  😉<figure id="attachment_1088" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 602px">

In April, I was driving to Austin for work and called my mom to chat.  She told me all about the Boston bombing and it hit me hard.  I was worried about friends and I just couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around something so terrible.  It caused me to think that if people could just live by three little words, the world would be a better place.  Those three words are &#8220;do no harm.&#8221;  And then I realized that I needed to live more by those words than what I had been doing.  So without doing any planning I called a co-worker and told her that I was going to get a tattoo before we had dinner that night.  I felt inspired, I guess, and I kind of love doing things on a whim.  It had been 17 years since I had gotten a tattoo, but I&#8217;m so glad I did.  There have been many times I&#8217;ve looked down at that tattoo needing the reminder.  Well, I have a big mouth and words can hurt.  Sometimes it&#8217;s best just to shut up.<figure id="attachment_1090" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1224px">

In May, I turned 35.  Instead of letting any negativity of a birthday enter my thoughts, again I felt inspired to pay it forward.  I was going to write an entire post on here about what I did, but again, I suck and never did it.  But goodness still prevailed.  I had put a post on Facebook asking for 35 friends to step forward and do a good deed with the number 35 involved.  I had many step forward, but I knew I was going to need more than 35 because life gets in the way and people have a way of letting things fall through the cracks.  Hey, it happens.  I get it.  Regardless, I was super impressed with the things that people did.  My sweet mom gave 35 pairs of shoes to kids in Oklahoma that had just suffered horrible devastation from tornadoes.  And another friend of mine gave 35 oranges and bottles of water to homeless people.  It was a WONDERFUL feeling when I got a ton of emails, texts, and Facebook messages regarding all of the amazing things that my friends did to help others.<figure id="attachment_1095" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 960px">

Then an awesome thing happened sometime in the summer months.  That yucky dark cloud that had been following me around just went away, and what happened was cyclical.  I got more praise at work, and I kept getting happier, and the cycle continued.

Work is pretty much my life, but I really wanted to figure out a way to still have as much of a balance as I possibly could with being gone from home so much.  One of the things that I wanted to make more a priority in 2013 was to see more live music.  I saw a few people that I was super excited about, but this is something that I still need to do more.  So add &#8220;see more live music&#8221; to my 2014 wish list.<figure id="attachment_1091" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 2448px">

One thing I did that wasn&#8217;t on my bucket list was go see Mt. Rushmore.  I was in Rapid City, SD for work and feel dumb for not knowing that Mt. Rushmore was nearby.  Regardless, I did the training on Tuesday with a small group of women that kept encouraging me to go see Mr. Rushmore.  So before I had to fly out the next day, I took a cab and went and saw something that should have been on my bucket list.  It was so cool!  And again, I felt complete gratitude for my life.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098" alt="me and mt rushmore" src="/wp-content/uploads/me-and-mt-rushmore.jpg" width="480" height="640" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/me-and-mt-rushmore.jpg 480w, /wp-content/uploads/me-and-mt-rushmore-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />

And speaking of gratitude, I just had a real vacation.  I haven&#8217;t had a REAL vacation in many years, so I was really looking forward to going to Puerto Rico with my mom and her husband for Christmas.  It was wonderful.  It was also a good learning experience.  And I&#8217;m looking forward to going back soon, and also taking more vacations like this.<figure id="attachment_1099" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1280px">

<img class="size-full wp-image-1099" alt="Yep, this is real!" src="/wp-content/uploads/PRbeach.jpg" width="1280" height="1236" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/PRbeach.jpg 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/PRbeach-300x289.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/PRbeach-1024x988.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Yep, this is real!</figcaption></figure> 

So basically my 2013 was a HUGE success and I couldn&#8217;t be happier.  I&#8217;m sure it annoys people when I go on and on about how happy I am, but I&#8217;m seriously in love with my life right now.  I&#8217;m blessed beyond words and I know 2014 is going to be amazing.  My horoscope told me so.  And my personal wish is for everyone to have peace for where they are in their lives.  It&#8217;s all a learning experience, so be thankful for what the universe gives you.  Yes, even the bad times.  I&#8217;m living proof that it can all turn around if you change your mindset.

I have real love in my heart.  Thank you 2013, and I can&#8217;t wait for all that 2014 brings me.  Now where&#8217;s my wine&#8230;..
