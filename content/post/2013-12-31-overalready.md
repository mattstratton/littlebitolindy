So I started this blog in 2013 with the hopes that I could have a place to share more than what I do on Facebook and other social medias. I also hoped that I would be able to become a better writer by writing on a more regular basis. Practice makes progress, right? Well, I suck. I wrote a handful of times and then didn&#8217;t make this a priority anymore. So while I feel badly about that, let me catch you up on my amazing life.

The first six months of 2013 weren&#8217;t what I was hoping for. Â Of course I had plenty of good moments, but there was a dark cloud that seemed to loom over my head. Â Then I had a co-worker who reached out to me and subsequently improved my life substantially. Â All she did was care about my well-being. Â I will never forget what she did for me, and I will forever hold her in very high regard. Â Slowly, but surely, things started to improve in my life and the cloud got smaller.

I joked around that I must have fallen and bumped my head, but from March to May (I think) I decided to try online dating (again). To say it was a disaster would be an understatement. Â It did make for some hilarious moments, though. Â It also exhausted me and I was quickly reminded that I don&#8217;t believe online dating is the way for me. Â Oh, and I also learned that ALL MEN LIE. Â Hehe. Just kidding. Not really. Â ðŸ˜‰<figure id="attachment_1088" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 602px">

In April, I was driving to Austin for work and called my mom to chat. Â She told me all about the Boston bombing and it hit me hard. Â I was worried about friends and I just couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around something so terrible. Â It caused me to think that if people could just live by three little words, the world would be a better place. Â Those three words are &#8220;do no harm.&#8221; Â And then I realized that I needed to live more by those words than what I had been doing. Â So without doing any planning I called a co-worker and told her that I was going to get a tattoo before we had dinner that night. Â I felt inspired, I guess, and I kind of love doing things on a whim. Â It had been 17 years since I had gotten a tattoo, but I&#8217;m so glad I did. Â There have been many times I&#8217;ve looked down at that tattoo needing the reminder. Â Well, I have a big mouth and words can hurt. Â Sometimes it&#8217;s best just to shut up.<figure id="attachment_1090" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1224px">

In May, I turned 35. Â Instead of letting any negativity of a birthday enter my thoughts, again I felt inspired to pay it forward. Â I was going to write an entire post on here about what I did, but again, I suck and never did it. Â But goodness still prevailed. Â I had put a post on Facebook asking for 35 friends to step forward and do a good deed with the number 35 involved. Â I had many step forward, but I knew I was going to need more than 35 because life gets in the way and people have a way of letting things fall through the cracks. Â Hey, it happens. Â I get it. Â Regardless, I was super impressed with the things that people did. Â My sweet mom gave 35 pairs of shoes to kids in Oklahoma that had just suffered horrible devastation from tornadoes. Â And another friend of mine gave 35 oranges and bottles of water to homeless people. Â It was a WONDERFUL feeling when I got a ton of emails, texts, and Facebook messages regarding all of the amazing things that my friends did to help others.<figure id="attachment_1095" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 960px">

<img class="size-full wp-image-1095" alt="I think I was shocked that I turned 35.

Then an awesome thing happened sometime in the summer months. Â That yucky dark cloud that had been following me around just went away, and what happened was cyclical. Â I got more praise at work, and I kept getting happier, and the cycle continued.

Work is pretty much my life, but I really wanted to figure out a way to still have as much of a balance as I possibly could with being gone from home so much. Â One of the things that I wanted to make more a priority in 2013 was to see more live music. Â I saw a few people that I was super excited about, but this is something that I still need to do more. Â So add &#8220;see more live music&#8221; to my 2014 wish list.<figure id="attachment_1091" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 2448px">

One thing I did that wasn&#8217;t on my bucket list was go see Mt. Rushmore. Â I was in Rapid City, SD for work and feel dumb for not knowing that Mt. Rushmore was nearby. Â Regardless, I did the training on Tuesday with a small group of women that kept encouraging me to go see Mr. Rushmore. Â So before I had to fly out the next day, I took a cab and went and saw something that should have been on my bucket list. Â It was so cool! Â And again, I felt complete gratitude for my life.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1098" alt="me and mt rushmore" src="/wp-content/uploads/me-and-mt-rushmore.jpg" width="480" height="640" srcset="/wp-contentuploads/me-and-mt-rushmore.jpg 480w, /wp-contentuploads/me-and-mt-rushmore-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" />

And speaking of gratitude, I just had a real vacation. Â I haven&#8217;t had a REAL vacation in many years, so I was really looking forward to going to Puerto Rico with my mom and her husband for Christmas. Â It was wonderful. Â It was also a good learning experience. Â And I&#8217;m looking forward to going back soon, and also taking more vacations like this.<figure id="attachment_1099" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1280px">

<img class="size-full wp-image-1099" alt="Yep, this is real!" src="/wp-content/uploads/PRbeach.jpg" width="1280" height="1236" srcset="/wp-contentuploads/PRbeach.jpg 1280w, /wp-contentuploads/PRbeach-300x289.jpg 300w, /wp-contentuploads/PRbeach-1024x988.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">Yep, this is real!</figcaption></figure> 

So basically my 2013 was a HUGE success and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Â I&#8217;m sure it annoys people when I go on and on about how happy I am, but I&#8217;m seriously in love with my life right now. Â I&#8217;m blessed beyond words and I know 2014 is going to be amazing. Â My horoscope told me so. Â And my personal wish is for everyone to have peace for where they are in their lives. Â It&#8217;s all a learning experience, so be thankful for what the universe gives you. Â Yes, even the bad times. Â I&#8217;m living proof that it can all turn around if you change your mindset.

I have real love in my heart. Â Thank you 2013, and I can&#8217;t wait for all that 2014 brings me. Â Now where&#8217;s my wine&#8230;..
