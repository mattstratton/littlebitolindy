Happy President&#8217;s Day!!

&nbsp;

And now that the pleasantries are out of the way, I have something to admit.  I&#8217;m a piler.  I know that&#8217;s not a real word, but I&#8217;m going to make it one.  Actually, my ex-boyfriend is the one that made it up to describe me.  What&#8217;s a piler, you say??  Well, it&#8217;s someone that likes piles, but let me clarify.  I don&#8217;t actually _like_ piles.  It&#8217;s just what I do.

&nbsp;

So I have the day off today.  I really have no idea why they gave us the day off, but I&#8217;m not going to complain.  I mean, I know it&#8217;s President&#8217;s Day and some people get that day off, but I don&#8217;t know why I technically have the day off.  Okay, I&#8217;m done trying to explain myself on that one.

&nbsp;

Anyways, so on my day off, I decided to spend it organizing my place.  I&#8217;m pretty freaking proud of myself, but I&#8217;m not even going to tackle my closets.  I need a couple of days for those bad boys, so I just worked on the piles I had accumulated in my living room.

&nbsp;

I have a desk in my living room because I don&#8217;t have an office.  I have two printers on my desk, but you really couldn&#8217;t see either one of them.  Somehow I had piled up all sorts of paper and other nonsense on top of the printers.  A friend of mine even came over the other day and immediately pointed and laughed at my desk.  Admittedly, I&#8217;m completely ashamed, so now I finally have only a tiny bit of crap on both of the printers now, which seemed like such a success until I realized that instead of a huge pile, I now have a tiny pile.  Why can&#8217;t I escape piles???

&nbsp;

In the middle desk drawer, that&#8217;s supposed to be used for my non-existent keyboard, I have been hiding away all sorts of papers that I should have trashed a long time ago.  So I finally tackled it and I shredded A LOT of papers&#8230;and then I accidentally knocked over the shredder once it was filled to the brim.  Fiddlesticks!!  Why am I so freaking clumsy??  And no, I haven&#8217;t vacuumed it up yet, but I&#8217;ll do that after I finish writing.

&nbsp;

I also have three baskets in my living room up against a wall.  I&#8217;ve completely filled them all with shoes because I&#8217;m too much of a lazy ass to put my shoes in the closet upstairs.  I know&#8230;.I&#8217;m pathetic.

&nbsp;

Oh, and my dining room has turned into a complete warehouse of work stuff.  I made a lot of progress on organizing it a couple of weeks ago, but essentially it&#8217;s just all very organized piles that are encased in cheap, plastic drawers.  Klassy.

&nbsp;

And I can&#8217;t believe all the stuff I found in my purse!  Does one really need to carry around 11 lipsticks with them at all times??  Apparently I do since I busted out another small makeup bag to put into my purse to house them all.  And I also found three flash drives, because I use those so often.  <&#8212;sarcasm

&nbsp;

Now I don&#8217;t want you guys to get the wrong impression.  I&#8217;m not a hoarder, but then again, hoarders probably started out as pilers and just let it get out of hand.  I like my place to be clean, which is why I hire a friend of mine to come clean my place every other week.  She most likely cleans around the piles.

&nbsp;

And I just keep thinking that if my place were bigger, then I wouldn&#8217;t have this problem.  But now I know that if I had a bigger place, I&#8217;d just create more piles, and I&#8217;d hold on to stuff so much longer than necessary.  More proof that I need to buy an Airstream, travel around the country, and try to live as a minimalist&#8230;.in 5 years or so after I&#8217;ve won the lotto.

&nbsp;

The craziest part of all this is that I have a slight obsession of buying things that are for organization.  I love shelves, drawers, folders, cabinets, and baskets.  The Container Store makes me shed tears of joy.  I&#8217;ve even tried to stop reading the catalogs they send me, so guess what I do with them.  Yep&#8230;..I put them in a pile.

&nbsp;

So why on Earth am I sharing this??  I seriously have no idea.  I was so proud of myself for doing this stuff and then I just really realized that my ex-boyfriend was right.  All I truly do is put things into piles.  I&#8217;m a piler.  I pile things and think what I&#8217;m really doing is organizing and cleaning, but I&#8217;m not really doing either of those.

&nbsp;

Try not to judge me.
