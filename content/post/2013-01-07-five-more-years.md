I&#8217;ll start this out by saying that even though I was raised Catholic in a small town in Texas, I don&#8217;t consider myself religious.  A lot of times I even call myself a recovering Catholic.  I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m more spiritual and I try to live my life by the Golden Rule, and I&#8217;m happy with the relationship I have with God.

&nbsp;

Without getting all churchy and serious, I firmly believe that it&#8217;s important about what we say out loud.  What happens in our brain sometimes happens without any control.  For example, I have a tendency to think of the most inappropriate thing I could scream in a grocery story, but I never do it.  My brain is just weird like that.  Maybe one of these days I&#8217;ll figure out controlling all of my weird thoughts, but step one was for me to start being very careful about what I say.  I&#8217;m a powerful woman. you see.  No, I can&#8217;t lift heavy objects with ease, but I have learned that I have to be aware of what I say.

&nbsp;

I first learned that I was a &#8220;powerful woman&#8221; when I was 23.  I was working at a spa doing makeup and I was very close to all of my co-workers.  We laughed, joked, and were mostly inappropriate as much as possible.  So one day, being the typical girl that I am, I asked aloud if anyone was sick.  I think what I really said was, &#8220;Hey! Anyone sick around here?  If so, let me drink after you.  I need to lose a few pounds.&#8221;  I thought I was being funny.  Everyone seemed to be healthy, so continued with work as usual.  For lunch that day, I decided to eat some fast food crappy burger in the food court at the mall, just like I had done a million other times.  At the time, I had no idea how powerful I was.

&nbsp;

Around 5:00 pm, I went to my friend, Stephanie&#8217;s apartment.  We lived in the same complex and could walk to each other&#8217;s places in about 50 seconds.  She and I had plans to go to the store and buy some stuff for my apartment since I had recently moved in.  She was sitting on her bed, talking to her mom on the phone while I was just lounging in the living room.  All of a sudden, I started to not feel very well.  I walked into her bedroom, plopped myself on her bed face first, and told Stephanie that I wasn&#8217;t feeling quite right.  She got off the phone with her mom and asked me what was wrong.  I wasn&#8217;t really sure at the time, but I knew that my stomach was starting to rumble a little.  I laid down on the couch, and within the hour, I was in the bathroom hurling my guts out.  I had been stricken with food poisoning for the first time in my life.  I&#8217;ll spare you guys the major details, but for 48 hours I lived on Stephanie&#8217;s couch and in her bathroom.  I couldn&#8217;t even walk home and suffer in my own space.  There were times I wasn&#8217;t sure which end would spew out the poison, so I finally just opted to sit on the toilet.  If I was going to puke, her bathtub was two inches away, and I figured it would be easier to stomach cleaning puke from a tub than the liquid crap that I was pooing.  I have no idea how Stephanie did it, but she was amazing, and she took care of me like no friend should ever have to.

The crazy part is that I&#8217;m not sure I had ever been that skinny.  After 48 hours of puking and peeing out of my butt, my stomach was concave.  I wouldn&#8217;t wish food poisoning on my worst enemy, but I sure wish I could be that skinny again.

She&#8217;ll kill me for posting this, but it makes me laugh so hard every time I see it.</figcaption></figure> 

The second time I realized I was powerful was probably about 9 months later.  I was at a dance event near Boston.  It was a combined lindy hop and west coast swing event, so I was surrounded by about 500 friends.  On Saturday, during the day, I was watching a lindy hop competition.  I was hanging out with friends of mine in the ballroom, and the competition was shameful.  This was some of the worst lindy hop I had seen in a long time, so it seemed like the perfect time for me to make fun of people.  (I&#8217;m a horrible person, I know.)  I told my friend, Andy, that my corneas were burning while watching this atrocity.  To be honest, I didn&#8217;t feel bad at all.  In fact, I was so proud of myself for coming up with something so clearly hilarious that I didn&#8217;t even think of the repercussions that could possibly happen.  Again, I didn&#8217;t know of my powers.

Dance event weekends are crazy.  It makes no sense when I tell a non-dancer that I watch competitions and dance until 7:00 am.  It&#8217;s crazy, but completely true.  And my adrenaline and excitement seems to limit my sleep to about 4 hours.  So when I woke up at 11:00 am on Sunday morning, I wasn&#8217;t surprised when my friend, Jojo was awake.  What really surprised me was that I couldn&#8217;t see out of my left eye.  It&#8217;s not like I couldn&#8217;t see anything, but everything was completely blurry.  I had zero pain and couldn&#8217;t find anything stuck in my eye.  At first, I joked about it.  I told Jojo that camera 1 was fine, but camera #2 was out of focus.  (I used to be obsessed with Wayne&#8217;s World.)  As the day progressed, my eye seemed to get worse and I started to feel anxious and frustrated.  I called my boyfriend who was back in Dallas, and he picked me up from the airport and immediately took me to the emergency room.  Apparently I had a huge scratch down the middle of my cornea, which according to the doctor should have been incredibly painful.  On a side note, this doctor was so weird.  He refused to make eye contact with me.  He stared at the ceiling non-stop, and I came so close to telling him that I don&#8217;t shoot lasers out of my eyes.  Anyways, I was prescribed a couple of drops and within two days, my left eye was back to normal.

So once I started looking back on various incidents, I realized that I am a powerful woman.  I also realized that I should be using this power for good and not for evil.  So since I was 24 years old, I&#8217;ve been saying that I&#8217;m going to win the lotto when I&#8217;m 39.  I felt like 39 would be the perfect age.  I&#8217;d be young enough to enjoy it and mature enough to spend it wisely.  And for the past ten years, I&#8217;ve believed that I&#8217;m going to win millions.

&nbsp;

So I have five more years to put this in the universe.  Are you powerful?  What do you put in the universe?

&nbsp;

Choose your words wisely, people.
