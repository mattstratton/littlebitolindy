It&#8217;s been a very long time since I&#8217;ve written on this dang blog. UNACCEPTABLE!

In my defense, I&#8217;ve actually written many times. I just haven&#8217;t published anything because of stupid excuses that got in my way. Sure, there were times I&#8217;d get stumped and then I&#8217;d get writer&#8217;s block, but then I&#8217;d abandon the entire post and probably just eat some cheetos. (They&#8217;re so delicious and awful for me, I know.)

I don&#8217;t know why today was any different, though. I just had a moment of creativity and had to message my friend who keeps this blog up and running for me because I couldn&#8217;t even remember my username and password. LOSER! Luckily, my friend is awesome and here I am writing now. I never said any of this would be good, though, so keep your expectations low. I just know I need to write more.

And my life has changed SO MUCH since the last time I wrote anything here. I think the last time I posted anything was when I was complaining about my voice being shot. Well, lucky for all of you guys, my voice is back and better than ever. Now I get to deal with annoying dizziness/vertigo, but I&#8217;ll bitch about that some other time.

So where was I? Oh yes, my life has changed! At the end of March in 2015, I moved to Seattle so I could work for my dream company and actually get to do my dream job. Crazy to think that I&#8217;ve been here almost two years now, but I am still absolutely LOVING living in Seattle and my job.<figure id="attachment_1199" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 1080px">

I thought I&#8217;d actually hate living in Seattle. When I was 22, I lived in San Francisco for a year and didn&#8217;t love living there. And Seattle has a lot of the same things that I didn&#8217;t love about San Francisco, but I guess I&#8217;m just older now and I appreciate other things more.

For example, the cold, rainy weather in San Francisco drove me insane. I was always cold. ALWAYS! And now I live in one of the rainiest places and am happy. Also, it&#8217;s important for me to say that I don&#8217;t think it rains here as much as what everyone thinks it does. And I&#8217;m from Texas where the rain is usually torrential downpour and here it just feels like God is spitting on you occasionally. And hey, sometimes you need God to spit on you. Admit it. We all deserve that sometimes.

It always rains here." width="1080" height="1080" srcset="/wp-contentuploads/space-needle.jpg 1080w, /wp-contentuploads/space-needle-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-contentuploads/space-needle-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-contentuploads/space-needle-768x768.jpg 768w, /wp-contentuploads/space-needle-1024x1024.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">See. It always rains here.</figcaption></figure>

Also, it was freaking expensive to live in SF, and Seattle ain&#8217;t cheap. I pay a ridonkulous amount for rent here, but I also save money in other ways. For example, my company pays for my health insurance and my birth control is now free. That shit cost me $125/month just for my birth control at my old job, and my insurance probably cost me just as much, too. Also, the electric bills here are stupid low and they only come every other month. I don&#8217;t get it at all, but my bill is usually around $40. My electric bill in Dallas was at least $100/month but could easily go up to $250 and I wasn&#8217;t even home from Monday-Friday. Makes no damn sense to me either, but I&#8217;m glad that part is cheaper here.

The other sucky part about SF was the homeless population. I would get so sad just going into work every day because of how many homeless people I would see and I knew I couldn&#8217;t help them. I had a coworker once tell me, &#8220;Lindy, don&#8217;t worry. One day you won&#8217;t even notice them.&#8221; And what he said hit me hard. That&#8217;s the problem right there. If you don&#8217;t notice a problem, then why would you ever fix it? Seattle also has a huge homeless population, but I&#8217;m older and wiser now, and know there are ways I can help, even if it&#8217;s just a little bit. I still have a lot more work to do if I&#8217;m going to attempt to save everyone, but I&#8217;m now committed to trying more because everyone deserves help and love.

So somehow I just love Seattle in spite of things that used to bother me. I had no idea how much living in a liberal city would make me smile more. Yep, I said it. I&#8217;m a bleeding heart liberal and never understood why someone thought they were insulting me by calling me that. And I&#8217;ll save my disgust for the current state of our country to another post because I could go on and on forever about my political views and opinions and this post is already long enough.

Speaking of this being long enough, I think I&#8217;ll end this with saying that I know I have sucked at writing regularly. It&#8217;s a goal of mine to change that. Writing is challenging and I feel like my skills have greatly declined in the last few years, and I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s due to lack of practice on my part. So shame on me, and here&#8217;s to me writing more&#8230;..even if it sucks.
