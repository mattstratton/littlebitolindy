Yet again, I can&#8217;t seem to write this dang blog on a consistent basis.  There&#8217;s a blog that I read called The Daily Love, and the writer, Mastin, basically bitch slapped me this morning.  I realize he doesn&#8217;t know me, but there&#8217;s a part of me that loves and hates it when his message hits home.  Basically, today he wrote about how he writes every day whether he&#8217;s in the mood or not.  After all, he did name the blog The DAILY Love.  Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t name my blog with time constrictions or else I&#8217;d really be screwed, but I do realize that in order to really challenge myself and do what I set out to do, I should probably write on a more consistent basis.

&nbsp;

So most of my excuses for not writing enough is because I&#8217;ve been so busy with work.  I love my job and am very passionate about what I do, but it sure does keep my brain busy.  Even last night I had a dream that I was selling a fragrance called Cancer.  I was in the aisle of a department store saying, &#8220;Have you tried Cancer?&#8221; Even in my head I realized it was stupid and ridiculous, and yet I still kept doing it.

&nbsp;

Now my job isn&#8217;t really to sell fragrance, but it is to educate people that work in the stores and to keep them inspired so they want to sell our products.  It&#8217;s my dream job in so many ways.  I love helping people learn how to be successful.  I constantly get to be around different people and personalities, which I totally adore.  I also get to travel almost every week, and I couldn&#8217;t feel more blessed.

&nbsp;

And even though I&#8217;m the luckiest person I know, I have a confession to make.  I&#8217;m a worry wart.  I struggle with saying this out loud mostly because it&#8217;s freaking hard to say.  It reminds me of my Puerto Rican mom trying to say Albuquerque.  She just can&#8217;t do it.  Anyways, it&#8217;s annoying as hell to dream about work.  I come across so many people that think I have it all together, but they have no idea how crazy my brain really is.  All day long and on a daily basis, I&#8217;m worrying about something.  Don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s unhealthy, because I already know.<figure id="attachment_1053" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 300px">

When I was in seventh grade, my computer teacher pulled me out into the hall one day to show me his teeth.  I seriously had no idea what was going on except that I knew I wasn&#8217;t doing well in his class.  He explained to me that I was a worry wart and that I needed to change so that I didn&#8217;t end up grinding my teeth like he does.

&nbsp;

My dad always said I was as sharp as a marble, which would cause me to sincerely say, &#8220;Daddy, marbles aren&#8217;t sharp.&#8221;  So needless to say, I was a bit dumbfounded when my computer teacher laid his wisdom on me so poignantly.  Me?  A worrier?  Didn&#8217;t everyone worry?<figure id="attachment_1054" class="thumbnail wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 300px">

So now, at the ripe age of 34, I am here to proclaim that my mind is draining and I&#8217;m tired of worrying.  Life is going to happen how it&#8217;s supposed to, and the only thing I can control is myself.  So I&#8217;m going to work on the things I can actually control, like trying to write more and even when I don&#8217;t feel like it.
